One morning, Mia was getting ready for school and she realized her house key was missing. She searched her bag, her pockets, and even under her bed, but it wasn't there. Her mother reminded her that she had played in the garden the evening before. Mia ran outside and looked near the swing. There, under the fallen leaves, she found her shiny silver key. She smiled, put it safely in her pocket, and hurried to catch her school bus.
